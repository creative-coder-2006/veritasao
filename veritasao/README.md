## üöÄ Key Features

### üîç Multi-Platform Analysis
* **News Articles:** Real-time scraping with `newspaper3k` and a robust `requests`/`BeautifulSoup` fallback.
* **Reddit Posts:** Official API integration via `PRAW` with a seamless simulation fallback for offline use.
* **YouTube Videos:** Deep content extraction using `yt-dlp`, enabling separate analysis of audio and video streams.

### üß† Advanced AI Detection
* **Misinformation Detection:** Fine-tuned BERT-based models with confidence scoring to assess factual accuracy.
* **LLM Origin Detection:** A powerful ensemble approach combining statistical analysis and a dedicated AI text detection model.
* **Deepfake Detection:** Advanced computer vision analysis of video frames using a pre-trained `R3D_18` model.
* **Audio Analysis:** High-accuracy `Whisper` transcription coupled with anomaly detection to identify audio manipulation.

### üìä Comprehensive Scoring System
* **Misinformation Score:** An ML-based probability of how likely the content is to be misinformation.
* **Confidence Score:** An indicator of the AI models' certainty in their own predictions.
* **Trust Score:** A holistic, multi-factor assessment of the content's overall trustworthiness.
* **Credibility Score:** An evaluation of the source and content quality.
* **LLM Origin Probability:** A clear score indicating the likelihood of AI generation.

### üö© Platform-Specific Flagging
* **News Sources:** Users can flag unreliable domains, contributing to a community-driven reputation system.
* **Subreddits & YouTube Channels:** The system architecture supports future extensions for community and creator-level risk tracking.

### üß† OpenAI Explainable AI (XAI)
* **Expert Prompts:** Utilizes platform-specific master prompts to guide the LLM into the role of a domain expert (e.g., "news analyst," "digital forensics expert").
* **Detailed Explanations:** Translates complex numerical scores into clear, human-readable summaries, making the analysis accessible to everyone.

### üîê Security & Privacy
* **User Authentication:** Secure user login and registration with password hashing via `bcrypt`.
* **Local Database:** Uses `SQLite` for a private, self-contained database, ensuring user data remains local.
* **Temporary File Cleanup:** Automatic management and cleanup of downloaded media files.
